This is my biggest coding project up to date. A mix of everything - collision, networking, graphics, low level stuff, testing, file IO. This is what sparked me to create the [allocator](https://github.com/supahero1/alloc) too.

It's supposed to be a fan-made version of the game [diep.io](https://diep.io). This is not affiliated with the game or the company behind it in any way. Though for now, it's not even playable and is just a coding sandbox for me to learn and experiment.

You need some libraries to build this. Most of them are listed in `MSYS2.sh` whether you're using msys2 or not. If you are, executing that file will get the packages, otherwise you need to retype the names in your package manager.

Just run `make` for some further instructions.

Very likely the code is broken or some files are excluded from compilation, because work is in progress.

Contributions that don't follow the code style or are wack will be closed without explanation.

I don't take suggestions.
